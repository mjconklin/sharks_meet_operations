This site describes the tools and procedures used to run a Schottland YMCA Sharks swim meet.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Coaches
- Place all swimmers into events prior to the start of the meet
- Oversee teams, and make adjustments to lineups as needed
- Enter swimmer and event data into Meet Manager before meet

- Stroke judges evaluate swimmers technique and disqualify based on things like:
  - Improper stroke techniques, such as flutter kick in a breaststroke event

  - Failure to perform a legal turn in an event, such as a one-handed touch in fly

### Lane Timers

- Times are recorded on paper timing sheets
- Use the 'plunger' button attached to each lane, as the swimmer finishes each race
- Ensure swimmer is ready for their race when called
- Head timer supervises all lane timers, and also has a backup stopwatch in the event of a missed start in any lane

### Console Operator
- Responsible for ensuring all events are recorded by the automatic scoring system

- Records stopwatch times for any event with a pad malfunction

### Clerks
