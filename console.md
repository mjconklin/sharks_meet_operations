## Equipment 

   - Daktronics console
   - Meet program labeled 'Score Table'
   - Pencil 

 

## During the Meet 

  - Ensure event/heat number on console matches event/heat on program
  - Receipt tape has a red stripe indicator when paper is low – be sure to install new spool when this appears
  - Make notes on meet program in the event of:
  -   Missing swimmer in lane
  -   Any scoring system errors that will impact the times of an event/heat
  - As the final swimmer in a heat touches the pad, press buttons in the following order:
    1. STORE PRINT (this will write all times to receipt tape)
    2. RESET
    3. ENTER
    4. NEXT EVENT, or HEAT +1 if additional heats remain in that event 

  - Be aware that events may not be consecutively numbered (For example, event 9 immediately follows event 5).  In this case, you will need to slowly depress next event button to increment console to appropriate number.   Do not press this button too rapidly – it will not register properly, but there is a limited amount of time between when the previous race finishes and the starter judge will start the next event.
  - On the final length of an event, the console display for each lane will display an asterisk symbol.  This means the scoring system is ready to record a final time for that swimmer.   If for any reason the swimmer is approaching the pad wall on their finish leg, and the lane indicator does not show asterisk, press the 'Finish Arm #' for the appropriate lane.

## Notes 

  - The console operator is critical to running a smooth, efficient meet.  It is not a difficult job, but requires nearly constant attention for the entire meet.
  - When coaches and officials approach the scorer's table, limit interactions to the computer operator to prevent distractions to the console operator.
