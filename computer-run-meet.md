## Meet Operations 
### Download Events to Console 
Prior to the start of the first race, the events from Meet Manager need to be downloaded to the Daktronics console.   This only needs to be done once, and will set the proper length for each event in the timing system.

In the main Run screen, choose 'Interfaces' -> 'Timer (DAK2) Pool 1' -> 'Download Events to DAK2'

### Get Times for Event/Heat 
After every race, times need to be retrieved from the scoring system.   This can be done asynchronously, but should be done periodically to keep the computer data up-to-date.   

This can be done by clicking the 'Get Times' button in the heat screen, or by hitting the F3 key.  You will need to click on the Heat number to select the proper race.

### Manually Entering 25 yard Event Times 
When completed timing sheets are received, enter both stopwatch times for each swimmer into Backup 2 and Backup 3 on the event screen.

When all times are entered, click 'Calc' to accept all the newly entered times.   Meet Manager will calculate the finals time for you, based on stopwatch times.

### Entering DQ Sheets 
Each DQ sheet should have event number, heat number and lane/swimmer recorded at the top.  If this is not completed, verify with the official before entering it into the system.

For an individual event, find the event in the main Run screen, and choose the proper heat.  Check the DQ button for that swimmer, and a pop-up window will appear in which you can choose the appropriate disqualification code, as recorded by the official.

For a relay event, if there is a stroke infraction on a swimmer, that will be indicated on the form, and a secondary selection window will appear where you can choose the proper disqualification code for that stroke.
