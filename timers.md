## Equipment 
- 2 handheld digital stopwatches (1 for each of 2 people assigned to lane)
- 1 'plunger' - semi-automated button attached to timing system
- 1 clipboard with timing sheets for assigned lane
- Pencil 

## During the meet 
- Make sure swimmer is ready for their assigned race/heat
- Write **_legibly_** to two decimal places (1:23.90, not 1:23.9)
- Person with clipboard will record both stopwatch times
- Person without clipboard will use plunger (attached to scoring system) when swimmer finishes event
- For 25 yard events, timers will move to shallow end of the pool.  Stopwatch times are important in these events as the automated pad system is not able to record finish times.
- Record notes about missed starts or adjustments made on timing sheets.  For example:
  - Swimmer missed assigned heat and was moved to later heat
  - Mark 'NS' for 'no swim' if swimmer assigned is not present
  - Swimmer went to wrong lane, but still swam in the event – note lane number
-  Head timer will also have a stopwatch started at the beginning of each event – if one person in your lane failed to start on time, alert the head timer so that they can record a finish time for the swimmer in your lane 
-  Do **_not_** pull swimmers out after their race has completed.   It can cause injury to their arms and shoulders.  If they need assistance, they can use a ladder if necessary, as long as it doesn't interfere with another swimmer's event.

## Notes 
- Plunger times are important for providing a semi-automatic backup in the event of pad time failure.  The timer with the plunger button only needs to press the button at the conclusion of the race – not at the start.
- Pads can fail to record an accurate finish time for several reasons
  - Bad electrical connection between pad and scoring system
  - Swimmer misses the pad on turn or finish
  - Swimmer lightly touches the pad, but doesn't exert enough force to send signal to scoring system
  - Lane pad was accidentally touched prior to swimmer finish (previous swimmer climbing out, e.g.)
