- During warm-ups, verify that all aspects of the timing system function properly
  - Scoreboard display works and shows event/lane times while running
  - Microphone and starter work, incluing triggering the timing system, strobe light and buzzer
  - Test each touch pad for functionality.  Verify plug is oriented properly in floor panel port.
